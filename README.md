Job-Based Points & Rewards Platform - README
Project Overview

This project outlines the system requirements for a web application that allows users to earn points by completing simple tasks and exchange them for rewards.

Target Users

Individuals seeking to earn rewards through online activities.
Functional Requirements

User Accounts:

Registration: Users register with a CID (Custom Identification Number) and password.
Verification: SMS verification is mandatory for account activation.
Login: Users log in using their registered credentials.
Session Management: Secure session management with timeout for inactivity.
User Interface:

Dashboard: Displays available jobs fetched from an API endpoint. Users can browse and select jobs. (API endpoint: https://api.example.com/jobs)
Profile Page: Users can view/edit profile details including photo, description, date of birth, gender, address, and phone number.
Implement a system to differentiate between "Verified" and "Unverified" users.
Rewards Page: Shows total points earned, a list of claimed rewards, and available rewards fetched from another API endpoint. (API endpoint: https://api.example.com/rewards) Users can claim rewards with sufficient points.
Work Page:
Users access a form based on the selected job (fetched from an API endpoint with job ID). (API endpoint structure provided)
The form should include basic functionalities like Cancel, Reset, and Submit buttons.
Upon successful form submission (JSON format provided), a "Next" button appears. Error messages will be displayed in case of submission failure.
Additional Requirements (For Future Consideration):

Security: Implement data encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
Points System: Define logic for points accumulation, expiration (if applicable), and conversion rate to rewards.
Notifications: System notifications for job updates, point changes, and reward claims (via email/SMS). Additionally, implement dismissible pop-up alerts for errors, success, and warnings. Users should be able to customize notification preferences.
Support: Include a Help Center with FAQs and user guides. Implement a ticket-based support system for user inquiries.
Reporting & Analytics: Track user activity, job completion rates, and reward claims for platform optimization (future implementation).
Testing: Implement unit testing (if possible), integration testing with static JSON data, and user acceptance testing (future implementation).
Documentation: Developer documentation (for future development teams) and a basic user guide (readme.md) are recommended.
Technical Stack (Replace placeholders with your chosen technologies):

Front-end Framework: NextJS
Backend Technology: Express, NodeJS
Database: PostgreSQL
API Design: RESTful API architecture
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)


Getting Started (For Developers):
